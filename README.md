# CNN_KNN_XAI

- This contains the colab file that uses InceptionV3 model for feature extraction and KNN as the classifier.
- Then, we are using XAI (explainable AI) methods, currently LIME and GradCAM (Gradient Class Activation Mapping), to show what our model is learning and the type of features that have been extracted from images for the same.
